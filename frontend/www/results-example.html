                  <p>Each nucleotide's chemical properties forces them to only link up with a specific
                    other nucleotide. This is where the simple beauty starts to occur (we think). There are two
                    categories:
                    <b>pyramidines</b> and <b>purines</b>. The pyramidines are cytosine (C) and thymine (T), and the
                    purines are guanine (G) and adenine (A). Cytosine always links up with guanine (<b>C-G</b> or
                    <b>G-C</b>) and thymine always links up with adenine (<b>T-A</b> or <b>A-T</b>). Two nucleotides
                    make a <b>base pair (bp)</b>—and these base pairs are what lead to variations in the <b>genome</b>
                    that create diversity and distinctiveness among populations and individuals.

                    that happens is through variations in the theme: <b>single-nucleotide polymorphisms</b>, or
                    </b>SNPs</b>
                    (pronounced snips). Less specifically, <b>single-nucleotide variations</b>, or <b>SNVs</b> (No one
                    knows
                    how to pronounce SNVs, but <b>sneevies</b> has been the scuttlebutt lately.), but we prune down to
                    only
                    the variants that occur in greater than 1% of the population—and those are the SNPs. We consider any
                    variation with a frequency less than that to be rare, and current methodology don’t support them.

              <p>Sometimes a nucleotide gets swapped out, kicked out, introduced to a new neighbor or even
                itself, and when that happens we get a <b>variant</b>. If we’re referring to a single variant at a
                precise location (or <b>locus</b>), then we call it an <b>allele</b>. So, if a specific nucleotide is
                expected to be thymine based on a <b>reference</b> (think of it like an average human's genetics), but
                it is instead found to be cytosine, we would refer to both T and C as the possible alleles for that SNP.

                though, they also include <b>indels</b>—or <b>insertion-deletions</b>—which belong to the larger family

          <p>Now that you understand the basic structure of DNA and genetic variants, let's connect the
            dots
            between those tiny molecular differences and the traits we can actually observe and measure—like your

              HERITABILITY
                   ======================================================================== -->
              <p>We’ve gone long enough without bringing up a term that is often misunderstood and—as a result—misused.
                That word is <b>heritability</b>.</p><br>

              <p>If you haven’t heard of heritability before, you might immediately jump to another word:
                inheritability. These are not the same word, and they mean <i>very</i> different things.</p><br>

              <p align="center">“Heritability is a concept that summarizes how much of the variation in a trait is due
                to variation in genetic factors” (Wray & Visscher, 2008).</p><br>

              <p>That is to say, it’s the <i>proportion</i> of a trait—like your educational attainment—observed within
                a
                population that can be explained by changes in the genome alone. It is <i>not</i> the chance the trait
                might be
                inherited. This is very important, because it allows for the <b>environment</b> to be a variable. The
                days of
                arguing over whether it’s nature or nurture that makes us all wonderful or terrible people. It’s
                <i>both</i>.

                  <p>Heritability is a push-pull between genetics and environment. If environment’s input goes up,
                    genetics’
                    goes down (you can’t have more than 100%, right?). The output is you (or a banana). And like any
                    good music in life or the stance on the healthfulness of butter, heritability is dynamic. As we
                    learn more, the ratio can change.</p><br>

              </p><br>
              <p>Simply put, a <b>phenotype</b> is an observable trait we can measure, like height or eye

              </p><br>
              <p>If you want a mnemonic, think of the <b>phenotype</b> as <i>physical</i> while the

                attainment, sometimes the <b>phenotype</b> is more abstract and intangible, but still measurable. And
                you <i>can</i> eventually touch a diploma, so we'll stand by our mnemonic.

                monogenic traits like flower and seed colors or texture in hybrids and offspring generations. Other
                monogenic traits we can see in humans include things like attached vs unattached earlobes, wet vs dry
                earwax or the ability to taste PTC (a bitter compound). More seriously, devastating diseases like
                Huntington's disease, sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis are also monogenic.

                    of many genes working or interfering with one another. Height has over 700 genetic variants

              INTRO TO GWAS
                   ======================================================================== -->
              <p><b>GWAS</b> (pronounced Gee-Waaah-Ss), an acronym for <b>genome-wide association study</b>, is a method
                used to find all the variants associated with traits and diseases. It scans the genome of thousands to
                millions of people and then compares the SNPs between people with different trait values (e.g., tall vs
                short height, married vs divorced or high vs low educational attainment).</p><br>

              <p>GWAS replaced the old <b>candidate gene studies</b> of the late ‘90s and 2000s, the method to blame for
                the over-hyped discoveries of <b>causal</b> or significantly <b>associated</b> claims for genetics,
                like serotonin and its role in major depressive disorder (claims that were spectacularly rebuked in a
                publication by Border et al. in 2019). We used to just suggest to colleagues over drinks, “Gene
                such-and-such is associated with heavy bloating effects on Thanksgiving,” and the next day start sorting
                people out into “bloating” or “no bloating” groups. What genes differ? Those must be the genes.</p><br>

              <p>Subsequently, journalists everywhere declare scientists have solved the mystery of why eating a metric
                ton of turkey and mashed potatoes causes excessive gastrointestinal pain.</p><br>

              <p>GWAS is <b>hypothesis-free</b>, in that we don't come in with a gene picked out for the study. We scan
                the whole genome for associations between any SNP and the trait we're interested in.</p><br>

              <div class="content-with-image">
                <div class="content-text">
                  <p>In contrast to those histrionic-inducing candidate gene studies, which had small <b>sample
                      sizes</b>
                    (i.e., not many people studied), GWAS requires very <i>large</i> sample sizes (hundreds of thousands
                    to
                    millions of people). This is because SNPs—individual variants—typically have incredibly small
                    effects on complex traits. So small, in fact, that the first GWAS disappointed people because of how
                    tiny the effect sizes were (i.e., how important the genes were found to be in its relationship with
                    a
                    trait). But with the increased <b>power</b> (larger sample sizes) this meant that those tiny effect
                    sizes were more accurate, and now we’re setting off a lot less false alarms thanks to GWAS taking
                    the
                    torch from candidate gene studies.</p><br>

              <p>With GWAS, and new, stringent statistical rules for when we claim significant relationships, we’ve
                started to realize just how many SNPs are involved in each of our traits—and while they all
                contribute a
                tiny fraction of variance (often &lt;0.1%), when you put together hundreds to thousands of SNPs, you
                end
                up with explanations for substantial heritability.</p><br>

              <p>Which brings us, finally, to your polygenic score. Keep reading.</p><br>

              <p align="center">⭐ It’s important to know GWAS can identify associations, but it doesn’t prove
                <i>causation</i>. SNPs can actually just tag along for the ride with their close SNP neighbors when
                getting stirred up to produce offspring (formally, "<b>recombination</b>" and "<b>inheritance</b>") with
                the combined genetics of parents. This is called <b>linkage</b>, and the result is what we call
                <b>linkage disequilibrium</b>. It’s why we have to be careful before making any claims about a SNP’s
                role in a trait.

                  </p><br>
                  <p><b>R²</b> (R squared) is how much of the <b>variance</b> (remember how you're different

            <div class="section-intro">
              <p>Educational attainment, in this context, refers to the total years of schooling a person
                completes—everything from kindergarten through potentially graduate school and beyond.</p><br>
              <p>This trait (or
                <b>phenotype</b>) is influenced by many factors: cognitive abilities, personality characteristics like
                conscientiousness and curiosity, family environment, socioeconomic opportunities, and of course,
                genetics
                too.
              </p><br>
              <p>The genetic component is highly <b>polygenic</b>, meaning thousands of tiny genetic
                <b>variants</b>
                each contribute a
                minuscule effect that adds up. The study used to calculate your score analyzed over 1.1 million
                individuals
                of European ancestry, making it one of the largest genetic studies ever conducted (Lee et al.,
                2018).

                  <!-- CONTENT: Explain GWAS, sample size, how PGS was built -->
                  <h4>Sample Size & Composition</h4>

                  <p>A 2018 study by Lee et al. combined the data of <b>~1.1 million</b> individuals from multiple GWAS
                    and consortia, including the UK Biobank, 23andMe and the Social Science Genetic Association
                    Consortium (SSGAC). Because of how small each SNP’s effect is on educational attainment, enormous
                    statistical power is required through a massive sample size to detect any effects reliably.</p><br>

                  <p>Educational attainment was measured as years of schooling completed, from elementary school through
                    doctoral degrees; but it’s important to remember: the phenotype captures formal education only. It
                    doesn't measure intelligence, knowledge or life success and nepotism.</p><br>

                  <p>Notably, however, the sample is predominantly of European ancestry. While continuous work improves
                    the diversity of our reference genomes, our samples still remain highly Eurocentric. This
                    <b>ancestry bias</b> is an ongoing and known issue in genomics research and limits accuracy when
                    applied to non-European ancestries. Remember linkage disequilibrium? There are chunks of our genome
                    that stick together for different, time-separated ancestries, called <b>haploblocks</b>. The result
                    is if someone with a very different set of haploblocks, perhaps Korean instead of German, gets a
                    predictive score about a trait, then the accuracy of that prediction is reduced, since it was built
                    on mostly European references.
                  </p>

                  <h4>How Your PGS Was Calculated</h4>
                  <p>Your polygenic score is a <b>weighted sum</b> of a whole bunch of your variants across the genome.
                    Here's the process:</p><br>

                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>GWAS identifies associations:</strong> The Lee et al. study identified thousands of SNPs
                      that were statistically associated with educational attainment. Each SNP was assigned an
                      "<b>effect size</b>"—how much that particular variant influences years of schooling.</li><br>

                    <li><strong>Your genotype is scored:</strong> For each SNP included in the PGS, we look at your DNA
                      to see which version (allele) you have. Some alleles are associated with higher educational
                      attainment, some with lower, and some are neutral.</li><br>

                    <li><strong>Weighted summation:</strong> Each of your alleles gets multiplied by its effect size
                      (the "weight"), and then all of these weighted values are added up. The formula looks like this:

                      <div
                        style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px; background-color: var(--card-bg); border-radius: 8px; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 1.1em;">
                        PGS = (β₁ × G₁) + (β₂ × G₂) + (β₃ × G₃) + ... + (βₙ × Gₙ)
                      </div>

                      <strong>Where:</strong>
                      <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                        <li><strong>β</strong> = Pronounced "beta," it's the effect size for each SNP (from the GWAS)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>G</strong> = Your genotype at that SNP (coded as 0, 1, or 2 copies of the effect
                          allele)</li>
                        <li><strong>n</strong> = Total number of SNPs included in the score (essentially it means just
                          keep going and
                          multiplying until you run out of betas and genotypes)</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 15px;">Don't worry, you won't be
                        tested on this.</p>
                    </li><br>

                    <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> The final sum is standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard
                      deviation of 1 in the discovery sample. Because of this normalizing, your polygenic score is also
                      a z-score (in your case, <b>3.5</b>).</li>
                  </ol><br>

                  <p>The PGS used here (<b>PGS002012</b>) includes thousands of genetic variants, each contributing a
                    tiny amount to your overall score. It's highly polygenic and complex. No single gene determines your
                    educational outcomes—it's the combined effect of many variants across the genome.</p><br>

            <h2>⚠️ What You Should Know</h2>

            <!-- CONTENT: Brief intro about why these matter -->
            <div class="section-intro">
              <p>Now that you've gone through a whirlwind course on genetics and learned how yours predict your
                educational attainment, it's probably good to lay out a few considerations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="consideration-grid">
              <!-- Not Destiny -->
              <div class="consideration-card">
                <div class="consideration-icon">🎯</div>
                <h3>Not Destiny</h3>
                <p align="left">We said it before, we'll say it again: your genetics are only a <i>part</i> of the
                  picture. And in this case, a small part. Remember, for this PGS, only <b>9.5%</b> is explained by your
                  genes alone.</p>
              </div>

              <!-- Environment Matters -->
              <div class="consideration-card">
                <div class="consideration-icon">🌱</div>
                <h3>Environment Matters</h3>
                <p align="left">The other <b>90.5%</b> contribution comes from the environment. Surround yourself with
                  what cultivates educational success. The genes will then fan that flame.</p>
              </div>

              <!-- Privacy -->
              <div class="consideration-card">
                <div class="consideration-icon">🔒</div>
                <h3>Privacy Concerns</h3>
                <p align="left">Be wary of disclosing any genetic information to others. While genetic discrimination is
                  not permitted, unspoken bias and discrimination can still occur. You're protected to an extent, but if
                  you start giving away your genetics, there could be consequences.</p>
              </div>

              <!-- Ancestry Bias -->
              <div class="consideration-card">
                <div class="consideration-icon">🌍</div>
                <h3>Ancestry Representation</h3>
                <p align="left">This score was developed primarily from individuals of European ancestry. For your South
                  Asian background, the prediction accuracy (<b>R² = 9.5%</b>) is slightly lower than the <b>~11%</b>
                  seen in European populations. This reflects differences in genetic patterns across ancestries, not the
                  validity of the science. More diverse studies are needed to improve accuracy for all populations.</p>
              </div>

              <!-- Wide Error Bars -->
              <div class="consideration-card">
                <div class="consideration-icon">📊</div>
                <h3>Prediction Uncertainty</h3>
                <p align="left">The prediction has wide error bars: <b>95% confidence intervals</b> means <b>±5.59
                    years</b> around your predicted value. That means your real value could be anywhere from <b>12</b>
                  to <b>23</b> years. Individual outcomes vary enormously, even for people with identical genetic
                  scores.</p>

                <h3>Your Path, Your Choice</h3>
                <p align="left">If nearly 18 years of school doesn't sound appealing to you, don't fret about it. Do
                  what makes you happy. Your genes aren't forcing you to get a Master's degree.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                  <p>The PGS is calculated purely from your DNA and its SNPs. There is no
                    environmental data involved. However, the effect sizes come from observational studies where
                    genes and environments were correlated. People with genetic variants associated with
                    higher education often grew up in education-rich environments (<b>gene-environment
                      correlation</b> or <b>rGE</b>); so the prediction captures both direct genetic effects <i>and</i>
                    some indirect
                    effects through correlated environments in the study population. This is a limitation
                    of observational GWAS: you can't <i>fully</i> disentangle nature from nurture.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                  <p>Use it to better understand yourself. View it as neither a limitation (if a PGS is negative or
                    predicts harmful effects) nor a prescription. Don't make major life decisions based solely on
                    a PGS. Certainly consider healthier habits should they help prevent a negative trait (like
                    Alzheimer's) and feel free to contribute to your genetic predispositions by enhancing your
                    environment, but focus on your interests, passions and opportunities. Those are more important than
                    a prediction.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                  <p>Not directly. Children inherit <b>~50%</b> of variants from each parent, but specific
                    combination is random. Your score won't ensure a similar score with your kids. Plus, as stated
                    previously, environment matters for <b>~90%</b> of the contribution of the trait. Your parenting and
                    the resources and opportunities provided matter more than inherited genetics.</p>

                  <p><b>R² = 9.5%</b> is moderate for behavioral and social traits. Height PGS can reach <b>~25%</b>
                    variance explained (more genetic). Schizophrenia PGS <b>~7-10%</b> (similar). Complex behavioral
                    traits like educational attainment are heavily influenced by environment though, so 9.5% is actually
                    pretty good for this type of trait.</p>
